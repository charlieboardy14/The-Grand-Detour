The 2006 Kia Picanto. A car so breathtakingly average, it's a wonder it doesn't come with a beige jumpsuit and a complimentary subscription to "Watching Paint Dry" magazine. It's the automotive equivalent of a participation trophy, a car that whispers, "I've given up, but not in a dramatic way."

They say it's "nippy" around town. "Nippy" is the word you use when you can't legally say "dangerously underpowered." The 1.1-liter engine produces a staggering 61 horsepower, which is less than most riding lawnmowers. Overtaking is less of a maneuver and more of a long-term commitment, a journey you embark on with the same sense of hopeful trepidation as a one-way trip to Mars.

The interior is a masterclass in the art of the bland. The plastics are so hard and unforgiving, they could be used to sharpen diamonds. The seats offer all the support of a wet paper bag, and the dashboard is a sea of grey, a monochromatic landscape that would make a Soviet-era architect weep with joy.

But the Picanto's true genius lies in its ability to make you question your life choices. As you sit in traffic, surrounded by cars that have actual personalities, you can't help but wonder, "Is this it? Is this all I am? A person who drives a 2007 Kia Picanto?"

It's not a bad car, not really. It's just... nothing. It's the automotive equivalent of a sigh, a four-wheeled shrug that says, "I guess this will do." And in a world of passion, excitement, and automotive artistry, "good enough" is the most damning indictment of all.

But, after all is said, it is the world's single greatest starter car.
