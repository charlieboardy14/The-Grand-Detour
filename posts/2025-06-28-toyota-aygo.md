Alright, let's talk about the 2016 Toyota Aygo. As a man who measures a solid six-foot-three and can bench press a small elephant, stepping into this car is less of an entry and more of a contortionist act. It's like trying to fit a fully grown grizzly bear into a shoebox. My knees are somewhere near my ears, and my head is practically scraping the roof lining, assuming there *is* a roof lining and not just a thin layer of optimism.

They say it's a city car. I say it's a car for hobbits, or perhaps very, very small children who've just passed their driving test. The engine, bless its tiny heart, sounds like a startled hamster on a treadmill. You put your foot down, and it responds with a valiant, high-pitched whine, as if to say, "I'm trying, boss! I'm really, really trying!" Meanwhile, I'm just hoping I don't accidentally deploy the airbags with my kneecaps.

The interior is... cozy. So cozy, in fact, that I'm pretty sure my shoulders are wider than the entire cabin. Every time I shift, I'm elbowing the passenger, who, if they're also a full-sized human, is probably experiencing similar levels of discomfort. Forget personal space; in an Aygo, personal space is a myth, a whispered legend from a bygone era of larger automobiles.

And the ride? Every bump, every pebble, every discarded chewing gum wrapper on the road is transmitted directly to your spine with the precision of a chiropractor's worst nightmare. It's not a smooth ride; it's an intimate conversation with the road surface, a conversation I'd rather not be having.

But hey, it's easy to park, right? You could probably parallel park this thing in a phone booth. And it sips **petrol** like a hummingbird sips nectar, which is good, because you'll need all the money you save on fuel for the inevitable back pain and chiropractor bills. So, if you're a person of substantial stature, or indeed, any stature that isn't miniature, approach the 2016 Toyota Aygo with caution. Or, better yet, just walk. It'll be quicker, and far less painful.
