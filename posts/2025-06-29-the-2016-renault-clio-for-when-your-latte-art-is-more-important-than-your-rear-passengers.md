  Your Rear Passengers"

Allow me to introduce the 2016 Renault Clio, the automotive soulmate of a very specific, very modern archetype: the "Urban Sprout." This is the car for the twenty-something professional who believes their personality is best expressed through a curated Instagram feed and a collection of houseplants they are slowly killing. They don't need a car for driving; they need a car for *arriving*.

From the outside, the Clio is a masterpiece of aesthetic deception. With its swooping lines and, most importantly, those "hidden" rear door handles, it pulls off a clever sleight-of-hand. It screams "I'm a sporty three-door for a carefree individual!" while whispering "but I have a place to throw my tote bag and that ficus tree I just bought." It's a design that prioritizes looking good in a tightly-packed street over, say, the driver's ability to see out of the rear window, which is roughly the size and shape of a letterbox.

My mother has one of these... and it is more of a disappointment than remembering that I share genetics with my brother. This box on tyres feels so uncoordinated, I often wonder if it remembers it has wheels. Besides that, it literally has no "Go" in it. I sometimes look down at the gearbox in rampant curiosity to make sure its not in reverse - as it would turn out... it's in fourth.

And what is with the ridiculous aesthetic customisations you see on everyone of these. I personally challenge you to find this car that doesn't have iridescent wheel trims shoddily plastered over them, or love heart stickers shoved on the wing mirrors.

Step inside, and the illusion continues. Dominating the dashboard is a large touchscreen that promises the slickness of an iPad but delivers the responsiveness of a self-checkout kiosk from 2008. It's surrounded by acres of glossy, "piano black" plastic, a material that looks stunning for the three seconds after you've cleaned it and before it becomes a forensic library of every fingerprint, dust particle, and speck of croissant that has ever entered the vehicle.

But what about the drive? For the Urban Sprout, it's perfect. The engine is just sprightly enough for the 30mph dash between brunch spots. The ride, especially on the fashionably large alloys, translates every city pothole into a direct assault on your spine, reminding you that you are, indeed, alive and in an urban environment. Take it on a motorway, however, and the engine develops the strained, wheezing drone of a domestic appliance having a panic attack, shattering the dream of a sophisticated continental cruiser.

And then there are the back seats. These are less a space for human beings and more a designer oubliette for the rare occasion a friend needs a lift. Legroom is a theoretical concept, and anyone over the age of twelve will find their knees intimately acquainted with their chin. It's the perfect penalty box, ensuring no one ever asks for a ride again, preserving the car for its true purpose: looking stylish while parked half on the pavement, with three reusable coffee cups nestled in the centre console.
