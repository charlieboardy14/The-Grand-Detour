I am proudly ignorant of the aesthetic difference between the Golf and the Polo, a wilful blindness born from the sheer boredom their designs induce. The Polo, in particular, looks less like a car and more like a doodle sketched by a half-asleep teenager who then slapped a title on it.

For nearly half a century, across seven generations, this joylessness-in-automotive-form has been the default choice for those who find the colour beige too exiting. It is a vehicle that suggests sensibility and quiet desperation in equal measure, with hundreds of thousands of units sold each year to people dutifully accepting their fate. At its core, it is an underpowered, budget Golf for those who aspire to one day be slightly less disappointed.

The Polo’s litany of faults isn't one of spectacular failure, but rather a slow, soul-crushing erosion of the will to live, punctuated by the dim, persistent glow of the check engine light. In fact, the car's dashboard produces such a cacophony of warning lights it could officially compete with the Blackpool Illuminations and its beachfront arcades. This tiny, amber beacon of despair becomes your most loyal companion... a constant reminder of the "sensible" choice you made.

The car’s primary flaw is its almost sentient ability to develop expensive problems at the most inconvenient times. The DSG gearbox, supposedly a marvel of German engineering, is particularly adept at this, often deciding to identify as a "box of neutrals" precisely when you're late for a job interview you already have no passion for. In this vehicle, you are not the owner, handler or the operator, but in fact the chosen victim of a vindictive German appliance.

And who is the driver of this vessel of vanquished dreams? A person who has recently given up. They project an aura of practicality that borders on the funereal, extolling the virtues of "build quality" with a conviction usually reserved for religious zealots, blissfully unaware that Volkswagen ranked a dismal 29th out of 32 manufacturers in the 2024 Driver Power survey.

Inside, the cabin is praised for being "roomy," offering a generous void to accommodate your existential dread. Volkswagen, in its infinite wisdom, has replaced functional buttons with a large, touch-sensitive pad, ensuring that the simple act of changing the temperature becomes a fumbling, distracting ordeal... a small, daily reminder of your powerlessness.

A tragic subset of this demographic is the "boy racer on a budget." This individual lowers their seat to the point of becoming a supine passenger, convinced their 1.0-litre engine possesses the heart of a supercar. They blast tinny drum and bass from factory speakers, oblivious to the fact that the only person they are impressing is the AA recovery driver on speed dial.

The Polo doesn’t just take you from A to B; it transports you from youthful ambition to quiet desperation, all with a five-star safety rating. It is, without a doubt, the most soul-crushingly competent vehicle ever conceived.
